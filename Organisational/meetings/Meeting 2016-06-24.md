# Roadmap Until Evaluation
* Search feature (client side implementation) for the movie selection [Max]
* Display character insight values in quiz results [Frank]
* Display movies for each character in the quiz [TobiK]
* Track elapsed time for each question in the quiz [Johannes]
* Allow to reset the quiz after finishing it [TobiK]
* Track the IP address when the quiz results are posted to the server [TobiR]
* Ensure a consistent behavior when accessing the `/quiz`, `/quiz-start`, and `/quiz-end` resources while the quiz has not been started yet, is in progress, has been finished, or has been reset [TobiK]
* Sort movies by popularity [TobiR]
  * Combine imdb rating and amount of ratings to derive a unified score which allows to compare all movies with each other w.r.t. popularity
  * Include imdb rating, amount of ratings, and unified rating in the API (swagger + actual implementation)
    * imdb rating and amount of ratings should be only provided in detail view
    * unified rating should also be provided in basic view (i.e. BasicMovie)
* Store quiz results [TobiK]
