# Meeting on September 9th, 2016

* Final presentation on September 30th: 15-20 minutes, with an additional discussion time of about 5-10 minutes
* Due date for report may be some days later
* Idea: Set polar chart as standard view for character comparison (and maybe also for character details)
* (Steffen) Does the quiz make sense when using only single dimensions?
  * Using all dimensions didn't work, but evaluation is required
  * First impressions of the new quiz show it might be better
* (Steffen) Idea: Write fake texts with specific emotional bias (e.g., very aggresive)
  * Check whether they lead to the intended results when using them for text upload
