# Informations of the meeting on 08.07.2016
* (Biemann) Exclude the occurrence of the same character within a question (if the same character occurs in more than one movie this might happen), just by string matching
* (because needed detailed explanation) Maybe add information on the quiz results (yellow lines / blue lines)
* (Steffen) Also display the actual calculated cosine similarity within the quiz results
* play with cosine similarity, calculations... 
* (Steffen) Find-Most-Similar-Chharacter Feature with a simple textfield to copy some text into it
* (Biemann) the max. / min. of a single characteristic is interesting:
  * Select some movies
  * Select something query like w.r.t. an attribute
  * display 10 or 20 characters on one line sorted in order of how strong the attribute is  (zeige Character auf Zahlenstrah)
  * maybe together with min/max selection?
* (Biemann)(if possible use results of first evaluation as labels for 2nd evaluation)
* (Steffen) Add button to quiz if some characters are unknown to replace the unknown question with a new generated one. Also keep track of this button as it might give insight about characters/users/whatever might be interesting in the end)
