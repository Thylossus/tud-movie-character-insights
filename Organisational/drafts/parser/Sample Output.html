<tr><th>RIDER</th><td>Hey -- sorry.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Leave it</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Did you change your hair?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CHASTITY</th><td>No.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>You might wanna think about it</td></tr>
<tr><th>BOY</th><td>(adoring) Hey, Bianca.</td></tr>
<tr><th>GIRL</th><td>Awesome shoes.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>I'm sure you won't find Padua any different than your old school. Same little asswipe mother-fuckers everywhere.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>(continuing) Any questions?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>I don't think so, ma'am</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>Then go forth. Scoot I've got deviants to see.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>(continuing) Patrick Verona. I see we're making our visits a weekly ritual.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>I missed you.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>It was a bratwurst. I was eating lunch.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>With the teeth of your zipper?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>You the new guy?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>So they tell me...</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>C'mon. I'm supposed to give you the tour.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>(continuing) So -- which Dakota you from?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>North, actually. How'd you ?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>I was kidding. People actually live there?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by the cows, though.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>How many people were in your old school?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Thirty-two.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Get out!</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>How many people go here?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Couple thousand. Most of them evil</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>We've got your basic beautiful people. Unless they talk to you first, don't bother.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>(continuing) Those 're your cowboys.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>That I'm used to.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse. They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>(continuing) To the right, we have the Coffee Kids. Very edgy. Don't make any sudden movements around them.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>And these delusionals are the White Rastae.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>(continuing) Big Marley fans. Think they're black. Semi-political, but mostly, they watch a lot of Wild Kingdom, if you know what I mean.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>(continuing) Derek - save some for after lunch, bub?</td></tr>
<tr><th>DEREK</th><td>(very stoned) Michael, my brother, peace</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>So where do you fit in all this?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Future MBAs- We're all Ivy League, already accepted. Someday I'll be sipping Merlot while those guys --</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>(continuing) are fixing my Saab. Yuppie greed is back, my friend.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>That girl -- I --</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>You burn, you pine, you perish?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Who is she?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Bianca Stratford. Sophomore. Don't even think about it</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Why not?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter. She's not allowed to date until her older sister does. And that's an impossibility.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MRS. BLAISE</th><td>Well, then. Oh, yes. I guess that does it for our analysis of The Old Man and the Sea. Any other comments? (with dread) Kat?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Why didn't we just read the Hardy Boys?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MRS. BLAISE</th><td>I'm sorry?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>This book is about a guy and his fishing habit. Not exactly a crucial topic.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(continuing) Frankly, I'm baffled as to why we still revere Hemingway. He was an abusive, alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of cats.</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>As opposed to a bitter self-righteous hag who has no friends?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MRS. BLAISE</th><td>That's enough, Mr. Dorsey.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>I guess the school board thinks because Hemingway's male and an asshole, he's worthy of our time</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(continuing) What about Colette? Charlotte Bronte? Simone de Beauvoir?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Mother Goose?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>Katarina Stratford. My, my. You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild. By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls. I was merely a spectator.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Tempestuous?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>(continuing) You might want to work on that</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>As always, thank you for your excellent guidance.</td></tr>
<tr><th>TEACHER (0.S.)</th><td>I realize the language of Mr. Shakespeare makes him a bit daunting, but I'm sure you're all doing your best.</td></tr>
<tr><th>TEACHER (0.S.)</th><td>(continuing) Ms. Stratford, do you care to comment on what you've read so far?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Not really.</td></tr>
<tr><th>TEACHER</th><td>Mandella -- since you're assisting us, you might as well comment. I'm assuming you read the assignment.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>Uh, yeah, I read it all</td></tr>
<tr><th>TEACHER</th><td>The whole play^</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELIA</th><td>The whole folio. All the plays.</td></tr>
<tr><th>TEACHER</th><td>(disbelieving) You've read every play by William Shakespeare?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>Haven't you?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>The fact that you're cutting gym so you can T.A. Sophomore English just to hear his name, is a little without in itself if you ask me.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>Who's that?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Patrick Verona Random skid.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>He always look so</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Block E?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(continuing) Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>Just a little.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>What's this?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>An attempted slit.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions. You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>But imagine the things he'd say during sex.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Okay, say you do it. You kill yourself, you end up in wherever you end up and he's there. Do you really think he's gonna wanna dace a ninety pound compulsive who failed volleyball?</td></tr>
<tr><th>COHORT</th><td>Virgin alert.</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>Lookin' good, ladies.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>Tragic.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Why do girls like that always like guys like that?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Because they're bred to. Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>He always have that shit-eating grin?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Joey Dorsey? Perma-shit-grin. I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class. And a model. Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>(continuing) You know French?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Guess who just signed up for a tutor?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>You could consecrate with her, my friend.</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>(re her dress) The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow. Tough break.</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>(practically spitting) They're running the rest of me next month.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>The people at this school are so incredibly foul.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>You could always go with me. I'm sure William has some friends.</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>Need a ride, ladies?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>That's a charming new development</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(yelling) Remove head from sphincter! Then pedal!</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>You all right?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>That's her? Bianca's sister?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>"Undulating with desire, Adrienne removes her crimson cape, revealing her creamy --"</td></tr>
<tr><th>SHARON</th><td>In the microwave.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>(to Kat) Make anyone cry today?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Sadly, no. But it's only four-thirty.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(continuing) Where've you been?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>(eyeing Walter) Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>Hello, precious.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>How touching.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>What's this? It says Sarah Lawrence?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>I guess I got in</td></tr>
<tr><th>SHARON</th><td>What's a synonym for throbbing?</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>I know.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>I thought we decided you were going to school here. At U of 0.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>You decided.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Is there even a question that we want her to stay?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Ask Bianca who drove her home</td></tr>
<tr><th>SHARON</th><td>Swollen...turgid.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>(to Bianca; upset) Who drove you home?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>What if she never starts dating?</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>Enough!</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>(continuing) Do you know what this is?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA AND WALTER</th><td>(in unison, by rote) The sound of a fifteen-year-old in labor.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>This is why you're not dating until your sister does.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>But she doesn't want to date.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>Exactly my point</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>(continuing) Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?</td></tr>
<tr><th>SHARON</th><td>Tumescent!</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>(to Sharon; as he leaves) You're not helping.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Can we make this quick? Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad. Again.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>(looking down) Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine. Saturday? Night?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>(embarrassed) Forget it.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Cameron.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser. My sister. I can't date until she does.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Seems like she could get a date easy enough...</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Why?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>That's a shame.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Let me see what I can do.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>You're in school for one day and you ask out the most beautiful girl? Do you have no concept of the high school social code?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you. So what's the point?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>What about him?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>(confused) You wanna go out with him?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>(impatient) No - he could wrangle with the sister.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>What makes you think he'll do it?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>He seems like he thrives on danger</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>No kidding. He's a criminal. I heard he lit a state trooper on fire. He just got out of Alcatraz...</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Forget his reputation. Do you think we've got a plan or not?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Did she actually say she'd go out with you?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>That's what I just said</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set. You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list. With me by your side.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>I thought you hated those people.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>So now all we gotta do is talk to him.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>I'll let you handle that.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PEPE</th><td>Some people like the Colombian, but it all depends on your acidity preference. Me? I prefer East African and Indonesian. You start the day with a Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian Sidamo in your cup, you're that much farther ahead than someone drinkin' Cosia Rican or Kona -- you know what I mean?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Hey, there</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>(continuing) Later, then.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Hey.</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>Are you lost?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Nope - just came by to chat</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>We don't chat.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you. You know, just to see if you're interested.</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>We're not.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>(grimacing) Hear me out. You want Bianca don't you?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>(continuing) But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>Does this conversation have a purpose?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her. Someone who's up for the job.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Exactly</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Oh, hey, nothin' man Purely good will on my part.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>(continuing) I have a dick on my face, don't I?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>You got him involved?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Like we had a choice? Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>You're one brilliant guy</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>William would never have gone to a state school.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>William didn't even go to high school</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>That's never been proven</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Neither has his heterosexuality.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(continuing) I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming. (pointing at her food) Do you mind?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>Does it matter?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious. Don't forget your tiara."</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>Janice Parker told me he was a roadie for Marilyn Manson.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Janice Parker is an idiot</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>(looking at chart) I don't understand, Patrick. You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Touch of the flu.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>I'm at a loss, then. What should we talk about? Your year of absence?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>How 'bout your sex life?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>What's to discuss?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>Fine. Go do something repugnant and give us something to talk about next week.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>Look, it's really easy.</td></tr>
<tr><th>TREVOR</th><td>You're a freedom fighter. Be proud, sister.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>(rotely) It's Mandella with two L's. I am not related to Nelson Mandela. I am not a political figure. I do not live in South Africa. My parents just spent a few too many acid trips thinking they were revolutionaries.</td></tr>
<tr><th>TREVOR</th><td>But you freed our people</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>Your "people" are white, suburban high school boys who smoke too much hemp. I have not freed you, Trevor. (grabbing his arm dramatically) Only you can free yourself.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>C'esc ma tete. This is my head</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Right. See? You're ready for the quiz.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>I don't want to know how to say that though. I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are. How much does champagne cost? Stuff like Chat. I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>That's because it's such a nice one.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Forget French.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>(continuing) How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Well, there's someone I think might be</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Show me</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Give me a sign when he walks by. And don't point.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>There.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Where?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>I guess he didn't see me (calling after Patrick) Some other time --</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>My God, he's repulsive. He's so perfect!</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>(shrugging them off) What?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Yeah</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>What do you think?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Two legs, nice rack...</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>Yeah, whatever. I want you to go out with her.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Sure, Sparky. I'll get right on it.</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>You just said</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>You need money to take a girl out</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>(sarcastic) Yeah, I'd take her to Europe if I had the plane.</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>You got it, Verona. I pick up the tab, you do the honors.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend. And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>How much?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>Fine, thirty.</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>(continuing) Take it or leave it. This isn't a negotiation.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Fifty, and you've got your man.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MR. CHAPIN</th><td>(proudly) Good run, Stratford.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Hey. Girlie.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>(continuing) I mean Wo-man. How ya doin'?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(smiles brightly) Sweating like a pig, actually. And yourself?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>There's a way to get a guy's attention.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>My mission in life.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(continuing) Obviously, I've struck your fancy. So, you see, it worked. The world makes sense again.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Pick you up Friday, then</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Oh, right. Friday.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>The night I take you to places you've never been before. And back.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Like where? The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>I know a lot more than that</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Doubtful. Very doubtful.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>(calling after her) You're no bargain either, sweetheart.</td></tr>
<tr><th>SCURVY</th><td>So I guess the Jeep won't be getting a new Blaupunkt.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>He took the bait.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Have you ever considered a new look? I mean, seriously, you could have some potential buried under all this hostility.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Can you at least start wearing a bra?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Hey</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>(continuing) You hate me don't you?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>And why would I do that?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>You -- covered in my vomit.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Seven-thirty?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Nice ride. Vintage fenders.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Are you following me?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Hi</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>You're not a big talker, are you?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(continuing) Hey -- do you mind?</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>Not at all</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>(continuing) You fucking bitch!</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>My insurance does not cover PMS</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Then tell them I had a seizure.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>I thought you were punishing me.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>Why can't we agree on this?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Because you're making decisions for me.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>As a parent, that's my right</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>So what I want doesn't matter?</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>You're eighteen. You don't know what you want. You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(emphatic) I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices. I want --</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>Christ! I want a night to go by that I'm not staring a contraction in the face.</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>When I shell out fifty, I expect results.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>I'm on it</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>Let me put it to you this way, if you don't get any action, I don't get any action. So get your ass on hers by the end of the week.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>I just upped my price</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>(turning) What?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>A hundred bucks a date.</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>Forget it.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Forget her sister, then.</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>You better hope you're as smooth as you think you are, Verona.</td></tr>
<tr><th>INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY</th><td>Cameron runs a sentence past Bianca.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>La copine et I 'ami? La diferance?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>A "copine" is someone you can count on. An "ami" is someone who makes promises he can't keep.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>You got something on your mind?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>You have my word. As a gentleman</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>You're sweet.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>(appreciative) How do you get your hair to look like that?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>You know, I read an article about that.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>You did?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>(without turning around) Say it</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>(clearing his throat) What?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>We wanted to talk to you about the plan.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>What plan?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>What is it with this chick? She have three tits?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure. Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>That's where we can help you. With Kat.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>So Dorsey can get the girl?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture. Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>(grinning) We're your guys.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Yeah -- we'll see.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>We're in.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>This is it. A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Will Bogey get bent?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Are you kidding? He'll piss himself with joy. He's the ultimate kiss ass.</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>Which do you like better?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>I think I like the white shirt</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>It's more</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Expensive?</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>Exactly (beat) So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Hopefully.</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>Good, 'cause I'm not gonna bother if you won't be there.</td></tr>
<tr><th>INT. TUTORING ROOM</th><td>Bianca sits across from Cameron, who's transfixed, as always</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Have you heard about Bogey Lowenstein's party?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Sure have.</td></tr>

<tr><th>MISCREANT</th><td>Nice song, Verona.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Flog me.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT (0. S.)</th><td>Excuse me, Mr. Chapin?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Sir, I'd like to state for the record that Mr. Verona ' s current incarceration is unnecessary. I never filed a complaint.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MR. CHAPIN</th><td>You didn't have to. He disrupted a classroom.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a simple serenade warrants a week of detention. There are far more hideous acts than off-key singing being performed by the student body on a regular basis.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MR. CHAPIN</th><td>You're not gonna change my mind, Kat. Rules stick.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Wait, Mr. Chapin. There's something I've always wanted to show you.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MR. CHAPIN</th><td>What?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>These.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MR. CHAPIN</th><td>I'm going to let that slide, Katarina. But if I catch you doing that again, you'll be in here with the rest of these guys.</td></tr>

<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(smiling) C'mon. It's not that bad</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Try lookin' at it from this angle</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Put your right foot there --</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Forget it. I'm stayin'.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>(voice trembling) Maybe.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>You shit!</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>The Partridge Family?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect. And piss you off.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Good call.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>I dazzled him with my wit</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>(sarcastic) A soft side? Who knew?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Yeah, well, don't let it get out</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>So what's your excuse?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Acting the way we do.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Something like that</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Then you screwed up</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>How?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>You never disappointed me.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>(continuing) You up for it?</td></tr>

<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Tell me something true.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>I hate peas.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>No -- something real. Something no one else knows.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>(in-between kisses) You're sweet. And sexy. And completely hot for me.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>What?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>No one else knows</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Go to the prom with me</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Is that a request or a command?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>You know what I mean</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>No.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>No what?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>No, I won't go with you</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Why not?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>People won't expect you to go...</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Why are you doing this?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>All of it -- what's in it for you?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(continuing) Create a little drama? Start a new rumor? What?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>So I have to have a motive to be with you?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>You tell me.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(quietly) Answer the question, Patrick</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>(angry) Nothing! There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>cover that up</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Quick question -- are you going to the prom?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>No...</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>do you listen to this crap?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>What crap?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Thank God! If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>(continuing) I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>What good stuff?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>The "real you".</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Like my fear of wearing pastels?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>(continuing) I'm kidding. (beat) You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"? And you don't know how to quit?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>(matter of fact) No</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.</td></tr>
<tr><th>TREVOR</th><td>You're gonna look splendiferous in that, Mandella.</td></tr>
<tr><th>TREVOR</th><td>(continuing) that's cool to say.</td></tr>
<tr><th>SHARON</th><td>Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>Pirate -- no question.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>The prom? Kat has a date?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>No, but</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>He's not a "hot rod". Whatever that is.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>You're not going unless your sister goes. End of story.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Fine. I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house. I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>(calling out) You know what happens at proms?</td></tr>
<tr><th>SHARON</th><td>They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home. Let her go.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>Kissing? Is that what you think happens? Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Come in.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(kindly) Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Like you care.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Joey never told you we went out, did he?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>What?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>In 9th. For a month</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>(confused) Why?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(self-mocking) He was, like, a total babe</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>But you hate Joey</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Now I do. Back then, was a different story.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>As in...</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>He said everyone was doing it. So I did it.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>You did what?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(continuing on) Just once. Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore. I wasn't ready. He got pissed. Then he broke up with me.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>But</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it. And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>(stunned) Why didn't you tell me?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>No. you didn't! If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>That's not</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>I guess I thought I was protecting you.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>I guess I'll never know, will I?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Come in.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Feel like shopping?</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>What do you wanna watch? We've got crap, crap, crap or crap</td></tr>
<tr><th>SHARON</th><td>Dr. Ruth?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Hi, Mommy. (looking away)</td></tr>
<tr><th>SHARON</th><td>Honey, you look beautiful!</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>You like? My date should be here in five.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>I'm missing something.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>I have a date, Daddy. And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Wow</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Let's go.</td></tr>
<tr><th>SHARON</th><td>(to Bianca) Have a great time, honey!</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>But -- who -- what --?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Hey, guys. I'm going to the prom. See you in a few.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>What just happened?</td></tr>
<tr><th>SHARON</th><td>Your daughters went to the prom.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>Did I have anything to say about it?</td></tr>
<tr><th>SHARON</th><td>Absolutely not.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>That ' s what I thought</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>I'm here to pick up Bianca.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>late</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>How'd you get a tux at the last minute?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>It's Scurvy's. His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>It's just something I had. You know</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>(smiling) Oh huh</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Look, I'm -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives. I was wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>No prob.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>are you ready?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(continuing) C'mon. Let's get this over with.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Quite the ostentatious display</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Look, Clem even wore his good boots</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>Have you seen him?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Who?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>William - he asked me to meet him here.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>Mi' lady.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>(surprised) What are you doing here?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CHASTITY</th><td>You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>I did.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CHASTITY</th><td>And just so you know, my date isn't planning on spending most of the night in his backseat.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CHASTITY</th><td>Joey Dorsey is only after one thing - - your cherry. He practically made a public announcement.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CHASTITY</th><td>(continuing) I wanted to tell you</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>My grandmother's .</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>What?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>That's where I was last year. She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her. I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl. I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune. End of story.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>That ' s completely adorable!</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>What's Bianca doing here with that cheese dick? I didn't pay you to let some little punk ass snake me.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>(to Cameron) Feces hitting fan. C'mon</td></tr>
<tr><th>MICHAEL</th><td>(continuing) Joey, pal, compadre. Let's take it easy.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Admit it. You lost. Be a man.</td></tr>
<tr><th>DEREK</th><td>Very uncool, my brother</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>I'm not your brother, white boy.</td></tr>
<tr><th>JOEY</th><td>(continuing) Just so you know -- she'll only spread her legs once.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>That's for making my date bleed</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>(continuing) That's for my sister.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>(continuing) And that's for me.</td></tr>
<tr><th>COWBOY</th><td>And that's for the fourth grade, asshole.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Wait I...</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>You were paid to take me out! By -- the one person I truly hate. I knew it was a set-up!</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>It wasn't like that.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Really? What was it like? A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>I didn't care about the money.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>(continuing) I cared about --</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>You are so not what I thought you were.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Are you sure you don't want to come with us? It'll be fun.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>I ' m sure .</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>You looked beautiful last night, you know.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>So did you</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>She okay?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>I hope so.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>Was that your sister?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>Funny.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>(continuing) I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food. Is this something I should be hip to?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>No, Daddy.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>(dreading the answer) So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Parts of it.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>Which parts?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>Bianca did what?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>What's the matter? Upset that I rubbed off on her?</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>No -- impressed.</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>(continuing) You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives. It means we've become spectators. Bianca still lets me play a few innings. You've had me on the bleachers for years. When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(hopeful) When I go?</td></tr>
<tr><th>WALTER</th><td>Oh, Christ. Don't tell me you've changed your mind. I already sent 'em a check.</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON (0. S.)</th><td>Katarina?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>I'd like to express my apologies.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>For what?</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>(looking down) I didn't mean for you to get -- When Bianca asked me to find you a boyfriend, I had no idea it would turn out so -- ugly. I would never have done anything to compromise your - - -</td></tr>
<tr><th>TEACHER</th><td>Who can tell me at what point Lucentio admits his deception?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(to the teacher) Family emergency.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Let go!</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>You set me up.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>I just wanted --</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>What? To completely damage me? To send me to therapy forever? What?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>No! I just wanted</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>Ladies? Shall we take a trip to my office?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>So you're the real bitch</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Yes! Okay? Yes -- I'm the real bitch. I wanted her to get a boyfriend so I could. Apparently, this makes me a horrible person. I'm sorry.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>(continuing) I swear -- I didn't know about the money. I didn't even know Joey was involved. I would never intentionally hurt you, Kat.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>(to Kat) Do you care to respond?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now? Or do I have some time to think about it?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>Just smack her now.</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>(to Miss Perky) We'll be getting back to you.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MISS PERKY</th><td>What, no hug?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>It's just you.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MRS. BLAISE</th><td>All right. I'm assuming everyone found time to compose, their poems. Except for Mr. Dorsey, who's still in ICU.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MRS. BLAISE</th><td>(continuing) Would anyone care to read theirs aloud?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>I'11 go</td></tr>
<tr><th>MRS. BLAISE</th><td>Oh, Lord.</td></tr>
<tr><th>MRS. BLAISE</th><td>(continuing) Please proceed.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>I hate the way you talk to me/ and the way you cut your hair/ I hate the way you drive my car/ I hate it when you stare.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(continuing) I hate your big dumb combat boots/ and the way you read my mind/ I hate you so much it makes me sick/ it even makes me rhyme.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>(continuing) I hate the way you're always right/ I hate it when you lie/ I hate it when you make me laugh/ even worse when you make me cry/ I hate it that you're not around/ and the fact that you didn't call/ But mostly I hate the way I don ' t hate you/ not even close, not even a little bit, not even any at all.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>A Fender Strat. You bought this?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>I thought you could use it. When you start your band.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>(continuing) Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Is that right?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>(continuing) You know -- it's not every day you find a girl who'll flash her tits to get you out of detention.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>You can't just buy me a guitar every time you screw up, you know.</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>I know</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>And don't just think you can</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Because I like to torture you.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Oh, Bianca? Can you get me my freshman yearbook?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Don ' t you even dare. . .</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>They do to!</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>They do not!</td></tr>
<tr><th>CAMERON</th><td>Can someone please tell her that sunflower seeds come from sunflowers?</td></tr>
<tr><th>MANDELLA</th><td>I can't remember a word of Shakespeare right now. Isn't that weird?</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>You're freaked over this, aren't you?</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>He's more than freaked. He's froke</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>I'd like to call your attention to Patrick Verona's stunning bad-ass look of 1995 ---</td></tr>
<tr><th>BIANCA</th><td>Patrick -- is that- a.</td></tr>
<tr><th>KAT</th><td>Perm?</td></tr>
<tr><th>PATRICK</th><td>Ask my attorney.</td></tr>
